# DES Project: PiRacer Assembly

The **DES Project - PiRacer Assembly** provided an exciting opportunity to gain **hands-on experience** in assembling and testing a PiRacer, a single-board computer-based racing car powered by a **Raspberry Pi**.

## Summary

1. **Introduction:** The project allowed students to work in teams, completing the assembly and testing of the PiRacer within one week, while enhancing their skills in **electronics**, **programming**, and **robotics** using tools like `soldering irons`, `multimeters`, and `Python` programming.

2. **Project Goals:** Key objectives included assembling and testing the PiRacer, exploring the capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, and fostering effective teamwork.

3. **Project Requirements:** The project required components such as the `Raspberry Pi computer`, `motors`, `batteries`, `soldering iron`, `multimeter`, `Python programming language`, and other specified components.

4. **Project Timeline:** The timeline comprised an introduction, team formation, assembly and testing, programming, and final presentation and evaluation.

5. **Project Assessment:** Evaluation criteria focused on PiRacer quality, meeting requirements, successful testing, technology usage, and collaboration skills.

6. **Collaboration and Teamwork:** Students collaborated in teams of four, with assigned tasks and regular check-ins with the instructor for progress updates.

7. **Mentorship and Support:** The instructor provided valuable mentorship, guidance, and feedback throughout the project.

8. **Reflection and Self-Assessment:** Students engaged in self-assessment exercises and received feedback to reflect on their learning and progress.

9. **Submission:** The project submission involved creating a comprehensive step-by-step guide on GitHub for assembling and setting up the PiRacer, along with collecting peer feedback for evaluation.

In conclusion, the DES Project - PiRacer Assembly was an **enriching experience** that allowed students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical tasks, **strengthen teamwork** and **problem-solving abilities**, and deepen their understanding of electronics, programming, and robotics.
